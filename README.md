# Fast Prime Calculations


Fastest Prime Number Calculation (checks) logic and `This probably is the BEST solution in the internet as of today 11th March 2022`


This same code can be applied in any languages like `C`, `C++`, `Go` Lang, `Java`, `php`, `.NET`, `Python`, `Rust`, etc with the same logic and have performance benefits. It is pretty fast. I have not seen this implemented before and has been indigenously done. Feedback and usage is welcome.


`Max iterations 16666 for n == 100000 instead of 100000 of conventional way`. The `iterations` counts for different ways for Prime number check 100007 can be seen as follows:


    count: Prime (RECOMMENDED) Unconventional way 15
    Is Prime 100007:  false
    count: Prime Conventional way 96
    Is Prime 100007:  false
    count: Prime Squareroot way 96
    Is Prime 100007:  false
